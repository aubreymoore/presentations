1) Likes/dislikes & pros/cons- we (hopefully) will be prone to listing our "likes" but let's make sure to include the major dislikes as well (things that we'd like to see changed).

2) What is the primary user audience - large/ small museum management? taxonomic research? is a dedicated IT / programmer required? Single vs multi-user? (annual cost should probably also be addressed)

3) GBIF - does the database provide data to GBIF, and details on how difficult or easy this is to accomplish etc

4) Barcoding (labels, not DNA) - does the database handle batch processing of specimens using barcodes, etc (and/or a general category on 'speed / ease of use')

5) Georeferencing - what georeferencing tools does the database provide, does it conform to the recommended 'best practices' guide published by GBIF?

6) What is the ease / difficulty of websetup?

7) Security - can a data entry technician accidentally delete or change (corrupt) large amounts of data? Is/are the database server(s) protected from disaster (eg floods, fires)?
