  abstract = {A study to determine the relative abundance and seasonality of forensically
	important blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in rural north-central
	Florida was conducted using pig carcasses (<I>Sus scrofa</I> L.)
	as models for human bodies. Seven species of Calliphoridae were collected:
	<I>Lucilia coeruleiviridis</I> (&#61;<I>Phaenicia</I>) (Macquart),
	<I>Cochliomyia macellaria</I> (F.), <I>Chrysomya rufifaces</I> (Macquart),
	<I>Phormia regina</I> (Meigen), <I>Chrysomya megacephala</I> (F.),
	and a few specimens of <I>Calliphora livida</I> Hall, and <I>Calliphora
	vicina</I> Robineau-Desvoidy. Species composition in aerial collections
	of adult flies, preserved larval collections, and samples of larvae
	reared to the adult stage were all highly correlated. Relative abundance
	of the species found was significantly different, with <I>L</I>.
	<I>coeruleiviridis</I> the most abundant species year-round. The
	relative abundance of the collected species varied significantly
	by day of decomposition and by season, with significant interactions
	between season and day, season and species, and day and species.
	<I>L. coeruleiviridis</I>, <I>C</I>. <I>macellaria</I>, <I>C. rufifaces</I>,
	and <I>P. regina</I> were found during the entire year, two <I>C.
	vicina</I> specimens and 11 <I>C. livida</I> specimens were collected
	from December to March, whereas <I>C</I>. <I>megacephala</I> was
	collected only from June through September.},

  title = {Thermoregulation in Larval Aggregations of Carrion-Feeding Blow Flies
	(Diptera: Calliphoridae)},
  journal = {Journal of Medical Entomology},
  year = {May 2007},
  volume = {44},
  pages = {516-523(8)},
  abstract = {The growth and development of carrion-feeding calliphorid (Diptera:
	Calliphoridae) larvae, or maggots, is of great interest to forensic
	sciences, especially for estimation of a postmortem interval (PMI).
	The development rate of calliphorid larvae is influenced by the temperature
	of their immediate environment. Heat generation in larval feeding
	aggregations (&#61;maggot masses) is a well-known phenomenon, but
	it has not been quantitatively described. Calculated development
	rates that do not include internally generated temperatures will
	result in overestimation of PMI. Over a period of 2.5 yr, 80 pig,
	<I>Sus scrofa</I> L., carcasses were placed out at study sites in
	north central Florida and northwestern Indiana. Once larval aggregations
	started to form, multiple internal and external temperatures, and
	weather observations were taken daily or every few days between 1400
	and 1800 hours until pupation of the larvae. Volume of each aggregation
	was determined by measuring surface area and average depth. Live
	and preserved samples of larvae were taken for species identification.
	The four most common species collected were <I>Lucilia coeruleiviridis</I>
	(&#61;<I>Phaenicia</I>) (Macquart) (77%), <I>Cochliomyia macellaria</I>
	(F.) (8.3%), <I>Chrysomya rufifaces</I> (Macquart) (7.7%), and <I>Phormia
	regina</I> (Meigen) (5.5%). Statistical analyses showed that 1) volume
	of a larval mass had a strong influence on its temperature, 2) internal
	temperatures of masses on the ground were influenced by soil temperature
	and mass volume, 3) internal temperatures of masses smaller than
	20 cm<SUP>3</SUP> were influenced by ambient air temperature and
	mass volume, and 4) masses larger than 20 cm<SUP>3</SUP> on the carcass
	had strongly regulated internal temperatures determined only by the
	volume of the mass, with larger volumes associated with higher temperatures.
	Nonsignificant factors included presence of rain or clouds, shape
	of the aggregation, weight of the carcass, species composition of
	the aggregation, time since death, or season.},
