Guam as a Source of New Insects Invading Hawaii

This note provides evidence that Guam acts as a stepping stone for new insects invading Hawaii.  This idea is not new.  Concerns of  new pests being introduced from Guam prompted the Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association to sponsor an entomological survey of Guam in 1936.  In his foreword to a report on this survey, [Sweezy1942] stated  "Guam is the most important station between the Philippines and Honolulu on the route of the Pan-American Airways across the Pacific, and as  knowledge of the Guam insect fauna was meager, it was deemed important to acquire as complete a knowledge as possible of this fauna.  Unknown insects were already being found in planes arriving at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, and, in spite of the system employed in the fumigation of the planes, an occasional insect was found which had not fully succumbed.  There was some concern lest unknown pests might survive and succeed in becoming established, and, perhaps, destructive to sugar cane and other crops grown in Hawaii.".  The 1936 survey identified 50 agricultural pests on Guam which were not present in Hawaii at the time. [Sweezey1942] commented "No doubt there are many among them which would become serious crop pests if they should reach Hawaii and become established."  Unfortunately, his words were prophetic.

[Pemberton1964] 
Polydesma umbricola Boisduval AGROTIDAE "probably came to Hawaii from Guam during World War II"
Dacus dorsalis Hendel "As much troop and other military movement occurred about this time between Hawaii and Saipan, where the fly occurred, this new pest could have come from the latter island."
Nezara viridula  "As this insect is known in Guam and Samoa but not in California, it possibly came from one of those islands."

Guam as a Source of Invasive Insect Species Entering in Hawaii


Entomologists have considered Guam as a source of exotic insect pests for many years. Live insects, intercepted on Pan-American seaplanes flying between Guam and Pearl Harbor, prompted the Hawaiian Sugar Planter’s Association to conduct a survey of agricultural pests on Guam during 1936 (Sweezy 1942).


Gressitt (1954) states the risk of accidental transportation of exotic pests aboard aircraft as partial motivation for studies published by the Bishop Museum in the Insects of Micronesia series: “Micronesia, with its trans-Pacific air route stops, is a connecting link between Asia and the Americas, with the consequent danger of the transportation of pests in either direction. In fact, several pests are known to have been carried in both directions, particularly with the increase in air travel of recent years. Some have been carried from the Philippines to Micronesia, and others, from Hawaii to Micronesia. Several, such as the Oriental fruit fly, have probably been carried from Micronesia to Hawaii. … Thus a knowledge of the insects already present in Micronesia, as well as the guarding against future movement of pests, is of paramount importance.”


The intent of this note is to examine Guam as a potential source of invasive insects entering Hawaii.


Guam, the largest island in Micronesia, has become a transportation hub for the Western Pacific region. Continental Air Micronesia currently provides direct flights from Guam to Honolulu each day, and an “island hopper” service from Guam to Honolulu via Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosraie, Kwajelein, and Majuro on alternate days. In addition, there are frequent military flights between Andersen Air Force base on Guam and military bases in Hawaii.
